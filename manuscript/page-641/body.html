"My aunt was a very reasonable woman, I believe, though she did marry for love. But you must remember that she died before I was born, and I have not, therefore, felt very much curiosity about her."</p><p>"But you recollect your uncle, I suppose."</p><p>"My Uncle Robert?" said Alicia. "Oh, yes, I remember him very well, indeed."</p><p>"Was <em>he</em> eccentric—I mean to say, peculiar in his habits, like your cousin?"</p><p>"Yes, I believe Robert inherits all his absurdities from his father. My uncle expressed the same indifference for his fellow-creatures as my cousin, but as he was a good husband, an affectionate father, and a kind master, nobody ever challenged his opinions."</p></div> </div>
