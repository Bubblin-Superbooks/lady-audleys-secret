His dark red hair grew low upon his forehead, and his bushy brows met over a pair of greenish gray eyes; his nose was large and well-shaped, but the mouth was coarse in form and animal in expression. Rosy-cheeked, red-haired, and bull-necked, he was not unlike one of the stout oxen grazing in the meadows round about the Court.</p><p>The girl seated herself lightly upon the wood-work at his side, and put one of her hands, which had grown white in her new and easy service, about his thick neck.</p><p>"Are you glad to see me, Luke?" she asked.</p><p>"Of course I'm glad, lass," he answered, boorishly, opening his knife again, and scraping away at the hedge-stake.</p><p>They were first cousins, and had been play fellows in childhood, and sweethearts in early youth.</p></div> </div>
