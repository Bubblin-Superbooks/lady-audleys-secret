<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>"Yesâ€”yes, Robert, dear cousin, I will remember."</p><p>Mr. Audley, for the first time since he had been a schoolboy, took his cousin in his arms and kissed her broad forehead.</p><p>"My dear Alicia," he said, "do this and you will make me happy. I have been in some measure the means of bringing this sorrow upon your father. Let me hope that it is not an enduring one. Try and restore my uncle to happiness, Alicia, and I will love you more dearly than brother ever loved a noble-hearted sister; and a brotherly affection may be worth having, perhaps, after all, my dear, though it is very different to poor Sir Harry's enthusiastic worship."</p><p>Alicia's head was bent and her face hidden from her cousin while he spoke, but she lifted her head when he had finished, and looked him full in the face with a smile that was only the brighter for her eyes being filled with tears.</p></div> </div>
