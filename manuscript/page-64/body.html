It was almost oppressive, this twilight stillness. The very repose of the place grew painful from its intensity, and you felt as if a corpse must be lying somewhere within that gray and ivy-covered pile of buildingâ€”so deathlike was the tranquillity of all around.</p><p>As the clock over the archway struck eight, a door at the back of the house was softly opened, and a girl came out into the gardens.</p></div> </div>
