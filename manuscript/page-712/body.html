"I am going to Mount Stanning with you to see this bailiff, and to pay and dismiss him myself."</p><p>"But, my lady, you forget what the time is; you can't go out at such an hour."</p><p>Lady Audley did not answer. She stood with her finger resting lightly upon the handle of the bell, meditating quietly.</p><p>"The stables are always locked, and the men in bed by ten o'clock," she murmured, "when we are at home. It will make a terrible hubbub to get a carriage ready; but yet I dare say one of the servants could manage the matter quietly for me."</p><p>"But why should you go to-night, my lady?" cried Phoebe Marks. "To-morrow will do quite as well. A week hence will do as well. Our landlord would take the man away if he had your promise to settle the debt."</p></div> </div>
