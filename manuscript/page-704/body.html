It contained only these words:</p><p>"Should Mrs. George Talboys really have survived the date of her supposed death, as recorded in the public prints, and upon the tombstone in Ventnor churchyard, and should she exist in the person of the lady suspected and accused by the writer of this, there can be no great difficulty in finding some one able and willing to identify her. Mrs. Barkamb, the owner of North Cottages, Wildernsea, would no doubt consent to throw some light upon this matter; either to dispel a delusion or to confirm a suspicion.</p><p>"ROBERT AUDLEY.</p><p>"March 3, 1859.</p><p>"The Castle Inn, Mount Stanning."</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
