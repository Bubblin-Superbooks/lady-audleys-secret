<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">had a few words last night upon the subject of money matters, which subject has always been a disagreeable one between us, and on rising this morning I found I was deserted! The enclosed from Helen was waiting for me on the parlor table.</p><p>"Yours in distraction and despair,</p><p>"HENRY MALDON.</p><p>"NORTH COTTAGES, August 16th, 1854."</p><p>The note from Mrs. Talboys was still more brief. It began abruptly thus:</p><p>"I am weary of my life here, and wish, if I can, to find a new one. I go out into the world, dissevered from every link which binds me to the hateful past, to seek another home and another fortune. Forgive me if I have been fretful, capricious, changeable. You should forgive me, for you know why I have been so. You know the secret which is the key to my life.</p><p>"HELEN TALBOYS."</p></div> </div>
