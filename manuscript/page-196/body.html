What could there be extraordinary in the simple fact of a gentleman being late for his dinner?</p><p>"I shall go and look for him," said Robert, snatching up his hat and walking straight out of the house.</p><p>But the question was where to look for him. He certainly was not by the trout stream, so it was no good going back there in search of him.
